- Client and Software Requirements:
The client, The Gaming Room, aimed to transition their Android game, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based format to cater to multiple platforms. The software requirements included facilitating multiple teams with unique names, ensuring singular instances in memory, and achieving compatibility across diverse platforms.

- Documentation Development Strengths:
In developing the documentation, I effectively outlined a proposed software design solution, emphasizing key aspects such as unique team and game names, singular instances in memory, and the incorporation of software design patterns like singleton and iterator patterns. The documentation provided a comprehensive roadmap for the development process.

- Process of Working Through a Design Document:
Working through the design document proved helpful by providing a clear blueprint for the software development process. Addressing unique team and game names, ensuring singular instances in memory, and incorporating design patterns provided a structured approach, aiding in the efficient translation of conceptualization into actual code.

- Revision Consideration:
If I could revise one part of my work, I would enhance the section discussing potential challenges or drawbacks of cloud platforms. While I touched on cost concerns, a more comprehensive exploration of issues such as data privacy, dependence on internet connectivity, and the learning curve associated with newer cloud technologies could provide a more balanced view.

- Interpreting User Needs:
Interpreting the user's needs involved prioritizing aspects like multiple teams, unique names, and cross-platform compatibility. Considering user needs is paramount as it ensures that the final software aligns with user expectations, leading to increased satisfaction and usability. Future iterations could involve more extensive user feedback and usability testing.

- Approach to Designing Software:
The approach involved a microservices architecture for scalability and maintenance ease. Techniques included containerization with Docker, RESTful API communication, and cloud-based storage solutions. Future strategies would continue leveraging cloud services, exploring serverless computing options, and optimizing storage and memory management for enhanced performance.
